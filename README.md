# IP Webhook Logger
Logs IPs that go to the site made with this program to a Discord webhook.

## Why I made this
I made this program to teach myself a little bit a flask (I thought I'd use discord.py aswell but I ended up using requests)

## Running the program
1. Download the repository and extract
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set your port, webhook URL and your IPInfo token in main.py (Get your token [here](https://ipinfo.io/signup))
4. Run `main.py`
5. `http://localhost:8080` will now ping your webhook!
